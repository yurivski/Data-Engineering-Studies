# Data Engineering Studies

Repository for publishing personal studies and experiments, and documentation of consolidated concepts of Python, SQL and other languages and tools applied to Data Engineering. This is not a finished repository, I will publish at least once a week about subjects I know or am learning and experiments I have already done or am doing to consolidate some knowledge and simplify code reading to maximize understanding. Feel free to read or get in touch to make suggestions and exchange ideas on related topics.

> **Objective:** Catalog consolidated concepts, practical experiments, code simplification, readings, interpretations and projects applied to Data Engineering.
